                        <strong>My Dearest Chloe,</strong> <!--Dear bebegurl HAHAHAHAHA-->
                        <p>
                            

I hope you’ll read this with the same care I used to write it slowly, tenderly, word by word. Because this isn’t just a letter. This is something I built for you not just with my hands, but with my heart.

I coded this letter for you.

Yes, I literally sat down, opened a blank file, and started writing you into lines of code not because I needed to prove anything, but because nothing else could contain everything I feel. Paper tears. Messages get lost. But code. code can live on. It can be reopened, re-read, and rediscovered just like the way I keep finding you in everything I do.

You see, Chloe, you’ve always been more than just someone I care about. You’ve been a rhythm in my day, a spark in my mind, and a peace I can never quite explain. Even when we’re apart, you linger in the pauses between my thoughts, in the silence after laughter, in the moments I wish I could share with you.

Every tag I wrote, every space I added, was like breathing you back into my world. As I typed each line, it felt like I was constructing something sacred. And maybe it’s silly to say this, but it felt like a shrine of sorts a temple not made of stone or marble, but of intention. A place for the memory of you. A place for the hope of you.

Because the truth is: I miss you more than I can express. I miss your laugh the one that spills out like sunlight. I miss your way of seeing the world, the way your eyes soften when you talk about something you love. I miss being near you, even in silence. Even when we had nothing to say.

I don’t know where we stand right now. Maybe we’re just drifting stars in separate orbits. Maybe you're happier where you are, and maybe I'm just a ghost from a version of us that no longer exists. But even if that’s true, I had to do this. I had to write you something that didn’t just fade into a feed or disappear into a chat box.

I needed to leave you something real.
<p>Something I made.

Something that says:
<p>You were worth the time.
<br>You were worth the thought.
<br>You are still worth the love. 
</p>


And maybe you’ll read this and smile. Or maybe you’ll cry. Or maybe you’ll feel nothing at all. That’s okay. I didn’t write this to change your mind. I wrote it because loving you changed me and I wanted to leave a trace of that somewhere in the world.

So yes, Chloe, I coded this letter for you.

Not because I had to, but because I couldn't not.

With all my heart,
All my flaws,
And all the hope I still carry,
  <!--Crush kita boss HAHAHAHAHA-->
                        </p> Yours, always, Tyshawnosaurus
